	 * 3. Finding First Non-Duplicate Element
To find the first non-duplicate element in a list of integers using a LinkedHashSet, we can use two sets: one to keep track of elements that have already appeared and another to maintain elements in insertion order without duplicates.

java
Copy code
import java.util.*;

public class FirstNonDuplicateFinder {

    public static Integer findFirstNonDuplicate(List<Integer> numbers) {
        Set<Integer> allElements = new HashSet<>();
        LinkedHashSet<Integer> nonDuplicates = new LinkedHashSet<>();

        for (Integer number : numbers) {
            if (allElements.contains(number)) {
                nonDuplicates.remove(number);
            } else {
                allElements.add(number);
                nonDuplicates.add(number);
            }
        }

        // Return the first element in the LinkedHashSet, or null if it's empty
        return nonDuplicates.isEmpty() ? null : nonDuplicates.iterator().next();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(4, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 5);
        System.out.println("First non-duplicate: " + findFirstNonDuplicate(numbers));  // Output: 6
    }
}
Explanation
We use a HashSet (allElements) to track elements that have appeared.
A LinkedHashSet (nonDuplicates) stores non-duplicate elements in insertion order.
If an element is found in allElements, it's removed from nonDuplicates.
The first element in nonDuplicates is returned as the first non-duplicate element.
4. Sorted Unique Elements
To get the sorted unique elements from a list, we can use a TreeSet, which will automatically remove duplicates and sort the elements.

java
Copy code
import java.util.*;

public class SortedUniqueElements {

    public static TreeSet<Integer> getSortedUniqueElements(List<Integer> numbers) {
        return new TreeSet<>(numbers);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(7, 2, 9, 1, 2, 9);
        System.out.println("TreeSet: " + getSortedUniqueElements(numbers));  // Output: [1, 2, 7, 9]
    }
}
Explanation
A TreeSet is created from the list, which removes duplicates and sorts the elements in ascending order.
5. Custom Object Set Operations
Here’s how you can define a Person class with equals and hashCode methods and use it with a HashSet.

java
Copy code
import java.util.*;

class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Override equals and hashCode to ensure uniqueness based on name and age
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Person person = (Person) o;
        return age == person.age && Objects.equals(name, person.name);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(name, age);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " (" + age + ")";
    }
}

public class PersonSetExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<Person> people = new HashSet<>();
        people.add(new Person("Alice", 30));
        people.add(new Person("Bob", 25));
        
        Person searchPerson = new Person("Alice", 30);
        System.out.println("Contains 'Alice (30)': " + people.contains(searchPerson));  // Output: true
    }
}
Explanation
The Person class defines equals and hashCode based on name and age fields.
HashSet uses these methods to ensure only unique Person objects are stored.
The contains method checks if a particular Person is already in the set.
6. Set Operations with Subsets
This method checks if one set is a subset of another. The same method works for any set type (HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

java
Copy code
import java.util.*;

public class SubsetChecker {

    public static boolean isSubset(Set<Integer> setA, Set<Integer> setB) {
        return setB.containsAll(setA);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<Integer> setA = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
        Set<Integer> setB = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4));
        
        System.out.println("Is setA a subset of setB? " + isSubset(setA, setB));  // Output: true
    }
}
Explanation
isSubset checks if setB contains all elements of setA using the containsAll method, which works for any Set type.
If all elements of setA are in setB, it returns true, indicating that setA is a subset of setB.
These solutions demonstrate how to use various Set implementations in Java for different use cases, including removing duplicates, maintaining order, sorting, and checking subset relationships.

Certainly! Let's go through this code segment step-by-step to understand what's happening:

java
Copy code
for (Integer number : numbers) {
    if (allElements.contains(number)) {
        nonDuplicates.remove(number);
    } else {
        allElements.add(number);
        nonDuplicates.add(number);
    }
}
Purpose of the Code
This code is part of a method designed to find the first non-duplicate element in a list of integers. We are using two sets:

allElements (a HashSet) to keep track of all elements we've seen so far.
nonDuplicates (a LinkedHashSet) to maintain the order of elements that have not been duplicated, while also ensuring they are unique.
Breakdown of Each Line
1. for (Integer number : numbers)
This for loop iterates over each Integer element in the list numbers. For every integer number in the list, we go through the following steps.

2. if (allElements.contains(number))
Here, we check if number is already in the allElements set.

If number is in allElements: This means we've encountered this number before, so it’s a duplicate.
If number is not in allElements: This is the first time we are encountering this number, so it’s not a duplicate (at least for now).
3. nonDuplicates.remove(number);
If number is a duplicate (it’s already in allElements), we want to ensure that number is not in nonDuplicates.

The reason for removing number from nonDuplicates is because we only want this set to hold elements that have not been duplicated.
nonDuplicates maintains the insertion order and only holds elements that have been seen once. By removing duplicates, nonDuplicates will ultimately contain only elements that have appeared once in the list, in their original order.
4. allElements.add(number);
If number is not in allElements, this line adds number to allElements.

This step records that we've encountered number for the first time, so if we see it again, we’ll know it’s a duplicate.
Adding to allElements ensures that next time this number appears, the code will recognize it as a duplicate and remove it from nonDuplicates.
5. nonDuplicates.add(number);
If number is not a duplicate (not yet in allElements), we add it to nonDuplicates.

Since this is the first time we've seen number, it might be a non-duplicate element, so we add it to nonDuplicates.
LinkedHashSet (nonDuplicates) maintains the insertion order, so elements are kept in the order they first appear in the list.
Final Outcome
After the loop completes:

allElements will contain all elements from the list, but it won't help us directly in finding the first non-duplicate.
nonDuplicates will contain only the elements that appeared exactly once in the list, in the order they first appeared.
By retrieving the first element from nonDuplicates, we get the first element in the original list that is not duplicated.

Example Walkthrough
Let's say the input list numbers is [4, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 5].

First Element (4):

Not in allElements, so we add 4 to both allElements and nonDuplicates.
allElements: {4}
nonDuplicates: {4}
Second Element (5):

Not in allElements, so we add 5 to both allElements and nonDuplicates.
allElements: {4, 5}
nonDuplicates: {4, 5}
Third Element (6):

Not in allElements, so we add 6 to both allElements and nonDuplicates.
allElements: {4, 5, 6}
nonDuplicates: {4, 5, 6}
Fourth Element (4):

4 is already in allElements (it's a duplicate), so we remove it from nonDuplicates.
allElements: {4, 5, 6}
nonDuplicates: {5, 6}
Fifth Element (7):

Not in allElements, so we add 7 to both allElements and nonDuplicates.
allElements: {4, 5, 6, 7}
nonDuplicates: {5, 6, 7}
Sixth Element (8):

Not in allElements, so we add 8 to both allElements and nonDuplicates.
allElements: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
nonDuplicates: {5, 6, 7, 8}
Seventh Element (5):

5 is already in allElements (it's a duplicate), so we remove it from nonDuplicates.
allElements: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
nonDuplicates: {6, 7, 8}
Final Result
After processing all elements:

nonDuplicates contains {6, 7, 8}, with 6 as the first element.
The method returns 6, which is the first non-duplicate element in the original list.
Summary
This code leverages the properties of HashSet and LinkedHashSet to efficiently track duplicates while preserving the order of first non-duplicate elements. The key operations involve adding elements to allElements, removing duplicates from nonDuplicates, and finally accessing the first non-duplicate element.
